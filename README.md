SIMPLE DECISION MAKING APP (RANDOMIZED SELECTION)

Overall Description: Users will be able to input different options they would like to choose between. The user will be able to either create a new list of options or choose from a pre-existing list they had created before that is saved onto their device/account. We will be starting off by allowing for basic text input but will later on implement an option to scan in text through the camera by selecting certain text from an image and an option to input images from the camera roll or taking photos on the spot. The app will randomly choose one of the options inputted and display that to the user.

StoryBoard Planning:
- Login Screen/making new account
- Main screen: old lists with option for creating a new list
- Another Screen (new list): uploading choices - there will be text input with a real-time updating list of said options. *TO IMPLEMENT LATER: camera option, a camera roll option, scanning in text/images option
    - Give option name list to be saved
    - Button to indicate user is done with input
- Another Screen (old list): shows list of text/images that was selected and has button to indicate the user wants the app to choose from that list. 
    - Gives the option for users to add to or delete from the old list
    - ‘EDIT’ option
- Last screen: gives final randomly-selected choice and guides back to main screen that’s updated with the new list
- Once the final item is chosen, before going back to the main screen and completing the selection process, the user will be given the option to keep the selected item in the saved list or take it out (pop-up?)
