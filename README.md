Transylvania  Final Project

Overall Description: A sorting app that helps a user make decisions by presenting two choices at a time and using a bubblesort algorithm to sort the choices from the most liked to the least liked, in numerical order.
- Users can access saved lists or create a new one
- Users can upload images from camera roll, take photos, or type options
- Goes through 2 options at a time, and once having gone through all the options, goes back over the options that were chosen in each pair until ranking is made of all options
- Gives option to title and save list once created

StoryBoard Planning:
- Login Screen/making new account
- Main screen: old choices with option for creating new choice
- Another Screen (new choice): uploading choices - there should be a camera option, a camera roll option, and a typing box
    - Crop option on the uploading screen, you can crop the image before uploading
- Next two screens: Presents all the choices, starting w all of them and then narrowing down to the most liked. Presents choices two at a time. If they input text, they are taken to the text screen and if they upload images they will go to the image screen after they upload all the images.
    - 2 pictures side by side
    - Text 2 rows
- Last screen: ranked list of choices, with the most liked being first. Option to save choices and also name the list.
